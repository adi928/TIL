This weekend I have been in a deep dive into smart contracts and cryptocurrencies. Anything remotely related to cyberpunk-ish feel, always has my attention and this particular interest was brought on by a referral to the Immunefi platform. Since this'll be a new domain to try my hands on bounty hunting, I'll try a more organized approach in learning.

For today:

- Started reading **Smashing Ethereum Smart Contracts For Fun and Profit**. Another paper called **Smart Contracts: Attack and Protection** in queue for reading. 
- Did a walkthrough of the [Damn Vulnerable DeFi](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/)
	- It is a small collection of exercises and was really fun in understanding them. It's like going through the OWASP list for the first time. I was able to solve one on my own, i.e. after reading all the other's solution.
- Tried following samczsun's article. But that proved too detailed and complicated for me. 
- Picked up one of the contracts from Beefy Finance as an auditing challenge. Hopefully, I'll be able to do a writeup of that soon.

To-Do for tomorrow:

- [ ] Setup a debugging enviroment for smart contracts. Remix IDE, maybe.
- [ ] Install Mythril
